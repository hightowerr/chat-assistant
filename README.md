Let me explain the flow of this chat assistant app in simple terms:

The app creates a clean, modern landing page with a main content area and a sidebar

Key Components:

Main welcome message with "Welcome to Salary Finance Chat Assistant"
List of features the AI can help with (FAQs and human requests)
A helpful sidebar with availability information
A bouncing arrow (↘️) pointing to where the chat widget will appear
Technical Flow:
When the page loads, it automatically injects the Voiceflow chat widget script
The chat widget appears as a button in the bottom right corner
Users can click either the bouncing arrow or the chat button to start a conversation
The chat interface is powered by Voiceflow's runtime environment
User Experience:
Users land on a friendly welcome page
They're guided to start a conversation through visual cues
The chat widget is always accessible for questions
The interface works responsively on both desktop and mobile devices
The app effectively combines a welcoming landing page with an embedded AI chat assistant, making it easy for users to get help whenever they need it.
